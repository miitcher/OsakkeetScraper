Handle missing metrics for companies (get-function returns None).
    * List all metrics that are missing, for all companies.
    * Check if the missing metrics are also missing on Kauppalehti.fi.
    * Store (known) truly missing metrics as None, and rest as "FAIL".

Check if there is any usable code in OLD_CODE.

Make the command line interface better.
    Could use the thing at work...

When scraping one company by id from command line, there is no company name.
    This should be scraped.

Time parts in Scraper to know what is the limiting thing.

Make code faster by trying:
    create process for every Scraper.get_*() --> metric
    create process for every Scraper.get_soup_*() --> soup
