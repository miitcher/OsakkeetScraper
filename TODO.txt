Add log file for speed testing
    When a speed test is run, the gotten data is stored.
    The "old_avg" could be an average of all former speed tests or just
        the most resent speed test.
    Should be different log files for different computers.

Add the running of speed test to the unittests.
    test_speed.py
    Then the speed is tested every time all the tests are run.

Make code faster
    All raw_soup:s could be first gotten, and then be analyzed

Check if there is any usable code in OLD_CODE

Handle missing metrics for companies

Make the command line interface better
    Could use the thing at work...

Should I use unicode instead of strings?

Change logger.info() to just print() where apropriate.
