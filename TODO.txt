Setup of logger be in its own place, from where it is called.

Check if there is any usable code in OLD_CODE

Go trough old functions at end of scraping.py
    Add tests
    Make functions return pretty_dictionaries
    Collect scraping functions into a Scraper class
    Check if raw_soup could be gotten fewer times
        This would mean less to download
        Some of the scraping functions use the same raw_soup
            Functions could take the raw_soup as input
            All raw_soup:s could be first gotten, and then be analyzed
                Timing the code, could make things clearer, if it is good to do

Handle missing metrics for companies

Make the command line interface better
    Could use the thing at work...

Time parts in program
    Check if there are some convention how to time your code (maby there is a module already)
    Add a new code-file that times the running of the program
        This does not feel appropriate to have in the unittests
            Unittests should test the timing-functionality
