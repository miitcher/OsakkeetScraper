Check if raw_soup could be gotten fewer times
    This would mean less to download
    Some of the scraping functions use the same raw_soup
        Functions could take the raw_soup as input
        All raw_soup:s could be first gotten, and then be analyzed
            Timing the code, could make things clearer, if it is good to do
    When every function takes its own soup, Scraping took [s]:
        25.23
        25.72
        25.08
        25.43
        --> avg: 25,365
    When sheared soups, Scraping took [s]:
        17.33
        18.12
        17.18
        17.40
        17.50
        --> avg: 17,506
    The scraping got 30% faster!

Check if there is any usable code in OLD_CODE

Handle missing metrics for companies

Make the command line interface better
    Could use the thing at work...

Time parts in program
    Check if there are some convention how to time your code (maby there is a module already)
    Add a new code-file that times the running of the program
        This does not feel appropriate to have in the unittests
            Unittests should test the timing-functionality

Should I use unicode instead of strings?

Change logger.info() to just print() where apropriate.
