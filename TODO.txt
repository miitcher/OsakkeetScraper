    Simple to call scraping

Go trough old functions at end of scraping.py
    Add tests
    Make functions return pretty_dictionaries
    Collect scraping functions into a Scraper class
    Check if raw_soup could be gotten fewer times
        This would mean less to download
        Some of the scraping functions use the same raw_soup
            Functions could take the raw_soup as input
            All raw_soup:s could be first gotten, and then be analyzed
                Timing the code, could make things clearer, if it is good to do

Modify storage
    Make storage format into json-files (.json)

Time parts in program
    Check if there are some convention how to time your code (maby there is a module already)
    Add a new code-file that times the running of the program
        This does not feel appropriate to have in the unittests
            Unittests should test the timing-functionality
