Time parts in Scraper to know what is the limiting thing.

Make code faster by trying:
    create process for every Scraper.get_*() --> metric
    create process for every Scraper.get_soup_*() --> soup

Handle missing metrics for companies.
    The companies that fails the scraping, should just not get the
    metrics that fails, but get the other metrics.
        The metrics they do not get, I need to check.
            The expected missing metrics are then not fails.

Check if there is any usable code in OLD_CODE.

Make the command line interface better.
    Could use the thing at work...
